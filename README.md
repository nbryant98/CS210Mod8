This project was to create an inventory tracking system for a grocery store. It solved the problem of being able to keep accurate inventory and quickly find the quantities available of specific items.
I think I did well on the classes, though I admittedly struggled on my main as I tend to have a hard time figuring out how to structure my code neatly
I think I could enhance my code by adding more comments for easier readability
The hardest part to write was the text formatting because I always forget what to use to make the code print look better, I used my textbook for help.
I think a lot of these skills are transferrable including the ability to make classes and loops to pull and print data
I think I did well with my commenting in some areas but I definitely could have used more to make it make more sense and more readable and maintainable
